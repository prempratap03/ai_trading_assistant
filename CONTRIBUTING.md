   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Describe your changes

## Code Style

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

### Documentation
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Update README.md for major changes

### Example Function Documentation
```python
def calculate_metric(data: pd.Series, period: int = 14) -> float:
    """
    Calculate specific metric for given data
    
    Args:
        data: Input data series
        period: Calculation period
    
    Returns:
        Calculated metric value
    
    Example:
        >>> data = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
        >>> result = calculate_metric(data, period=5)
